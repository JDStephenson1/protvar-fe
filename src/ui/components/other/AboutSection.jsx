    <h3>About PepVEP</h3>
    <p>
      PepVEP is an intuitive web resource for scientists to interpret the effects of genomic variants 
      on protein function or structure per residue altered by a genomic variant. It unites existing 
      genomic and protein EMBL-EBI expertise; providing functional information from the Variant Effect 
      Predictor (VEP), UniProt functional residue annotation (Protein function), and PDBe structural 
      residue annotation in an integrated platform.
